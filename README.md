<code style="color : aqua"> <samp>Our project was inspired by rates of asthma in Detroit, Michigan, whose asthma rates are among the highest in the country. The consensus for the cause of Detroitâ€™s asthma rates are the presence of superfund sites. What is a superfund site? Superfund sites are sites that are located across the country that contain high concentrations of contaminants that pose a health risk to their surrounding communities.</samp> </code>

## Features

### Interactive Map
Map is centered at GeoCoordinates [37.09, -95.71] (the United States), with a zoom level of 2.5. The size of each marker on the map is proportional to the magnitude of the earthquake. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with lower magnitudes appear smaller. The legend on the map provides the earthquake's depth in kilometers; red indicates the depth is greater than 90km, yellow indicates the depth is greater than 70km, and green indicates the depth less than 10 km. Clicking on a marker will display the earthquake's location, date, time, depth (km), and magnitude (Richter). The map can be moved to explore different parts of the world by clicking and dragging. Their is a legend showing the depth (km) and the earthquakes corresponding depth color.
